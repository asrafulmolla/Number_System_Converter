<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p>
This C++ program provides a menu-driven interface for converting numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations. Here's a summary of what the program does:<br>

It includes necessary header files such as <iostream>, <string>, and <cmath>. <br>

It defines functions for conversion between decimal and binary, decimal and octal, decimal and hexadecimal, binary and decimal, binary and octal, binary and hexadecimal, octal and decimal, octal and binary, octal and hexadecimal, hexadecimal and decimal, hexadecimal and binary, and hexadecimal and octal.<br>

In the main() function:<br>

- It prompts the user to choose a conversion type from the menu.<br>
- Reads the user's choice.<br>
- Based on the choice, it prompts the user for the input number in the appropriate format (decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal).<br>
- It performs the conversion using the corresponding functions defined earlier.<br>
- Outputs the result of the conversion.<br>
It handles invalid choices entered by the user by displaying an error message.

The program terminates after displaying the result of the conversion.<br>

Overall, this program provides a versatile tool for converting numbers between different numerical systems.<br>
